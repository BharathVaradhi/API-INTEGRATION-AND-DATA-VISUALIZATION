DESCRIPTION:
This Python code allows users to input a list of movie names, fetches their IMDb ratings using the IMDb library, and visualizes the results using Matplotlib. The IMDb library is used to search for movies on IMDb and retrieve details like their ratings. After fetching the ratings, the Matplotlib library is used to create a bar chart, where each movie title is displayed on the x-axis, and its corresponding IMDb rating is shown on the y-axis. The chart helps visually compare the ratings of the entered movies. The code also handles user input, processes the movie names, and ensures that ratings are displayed for valid movies. If a movie is not found or lacks a rating, the user is notified. This combination of the IMDb library and Matplotlib is useful for building movie-related applications and analyzing movie ratings in a clear, visual format.
